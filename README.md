# DGORL
DGORL: Distributed Graph Optimization based Relative Localization of Multi-Robot Systems

## Overview
By creating relative position-weighted connectivity graphs using RSSI as local sensor data, expanding these graphs based on potential positions at a particular location, and then further optimizing to obtain relative position estimates for all connected robots, DGORL seeks to efficiently achieve high localization accuracy. An overview of the DGORLÂ configuration space can be found in Figure below:

## Requirements
* C++ requirements.   
([pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) is also required, but it's built in this repository, you don't need to install)
* python 3.6+
* [g2o installed](https://github.com/uoip/g2opy.git)

### g2o Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/uoip/g2opy.git
$ cd g2opy
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j8
$ cd ..
$ python setup.py install
```
Tested under Ubuntu 16.04, Python 3.6+.

## About Repository
This repository contains script *graph_optimization_mrl.py* to simulate the DGORL on 60 x 60 m workspace based on g2o optimizer along with the graph input files in [g2o format](https://github.com/uoip/g2opy.git).


## How to run
```
$ git clone https://github.com/herolab-uga/DGORL.git
$ cd DGORL
$ python3 graph_optimization_mrl.py
```
## Setup parameters
You can set following paramters in [script](graph_optimization_mrl.py):
1. number of robots
2. number of iterations
3. workspace dimensions
4. number of max_iterations for optimizer
5. dampting factory for optimizer
